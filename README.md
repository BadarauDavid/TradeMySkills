## Project Description 
The "Trade My Skills" project is an newly resourceful web platform designed to bridge the gap between individuals seeking specific services and skilled professionals ready to offer their expertise. This dynamic website serves as a centralized hub where people can post their service requests and skilled workers can propose their services, creating a harmonious marketplace for service seekers and providers.

### Technologies Used

In the development of Trade-My-Skills, we harnessed an array of technologies, each serving a vital role:

- Java with Spring Boot: This combination allowed us to expedite Java application development while enabling the creation of vital APIs and database repositories;

- JavaScript: Utilized to enhance the front-end with dynamic interactivity and creating a user-friendly interface;

- React: Renowned for its capacity to construct interactive and dynamic UI components, React served as our primary library for web application development.

- PostgreSQL: Acting as our primary database management system, PostgreSQL ensured efficient data storage and retrieval.

- Postman: Facilitated API testing and validation, ensuring the reliability and functionality of our APIs.

- Bootstrap: For creating impressive and responsive styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.


### Chalanges

During development, we encountered a few challenges that managed to teach us important lessons, including:

- Spring Security: As first-time users of Spring Security, implementing security measures with Spring Security posed a substantial learning curve.

- Editing Objects and optimizing Database Architecture for a better performance, scalability and simpler design.

- GitHub Conflicts;

### Future Plans
Our future plans for Trade-My-Skills platform include:

- Automated Location Detection: This feature will allow users to post ads without manually specifying their location. By seamlessly determining the user's location, we aim to simplify the posting process and make it more convenient for our users.

- Bidding Capability for Workers: This feature will enable workers to showcase their skills and compete for opportunities, ultimately benefiting both job posters and skilled professionals. It will create a more transparent and competitive environment on the platform.

- Subscription Plans for Bidders: Recognizing the needs of active bidders, we plan to introduce subscription plans that offer enhanced capabilities. Subscribed bidders will have the ability to bid on multiple ads per day, providing them with greater flexibility and access to a wider range of opportunities. This subscription model will cater to workers who want to maximize their participation on Trade My Skills.
